## Optimizations Implemented

To achieve high performance and low load time, the following optimizations were applied:

- **Minimized Render Blocking Resources:** Used optimized CSS and JavaScript bundles to prevent unnecessary blocking of the rendering process.  
- **Efficient State Management:** Used React Query to fetch and cache data efficiently, reducing redundant network requests.  
- **CDN & Caching Strategies:** Leveraged Vercelâ€™s CDN for faster global delivery and caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data.  

This ensures the application remains **lightweight, fast, and highly responsive**, providing an optimal user experience.
